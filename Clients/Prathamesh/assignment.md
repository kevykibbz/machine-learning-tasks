### Question 1: Tableau Design (LO1, LO2)
• Report and Visualization Design:
Design a set of reports, dashboards, and visualizations in Tableau that effectively represent relevant data related to the Titanic dataset.
• Justification of Design Choices:
Justify your design choices, explaining how each visualization contributes to conveying meaningful insights.
• Interactive Elements:
Demonstrate how these interactive features can be utilized to explore different aspects of the Titanic dataset.

### Question 2: Machine Learning and Tableau Integration (LO3)
• Machine Learning Integration:
Implement a machine-learning solution for predicting survival in the Titanic dataset using a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python).
• Tableau Integration:
Integrate the machine learning model with Tableau to showcase predictions, insights, or classifications directly within the Tableau environment.
• Storytelling and Prescriptive Analytics:
Develop a storytelling narrative within Tableau that walks through the problem, solution, and insights derived from the integrated machine learning model.

### Submission Guidelines: 
Prepare a comprehensive report showcasing your Tableau design and machine learning integration:
• Include screenshots or links to Tableau dashboards and visualizations.
• Justify design choices, explaining how each visualization contributes to conveying meaningful insights.
• Demonstrate interactive features used to explore different aspects of the Titanic dataset.
• Implement a machine-learning solution in a programming language of your choice and integrate it with Tableau.
• Develop a storytelling narrative within Tableau, walking through the problem, solution, and insights derived from the integrated machine learning model.
